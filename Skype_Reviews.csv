But I also hope that you could do something like zoom or google meet, but don't let anyone kick or mute anyone. Only the host can mute and kick people out of the meeting. In zoomium, I would like people to draw if the host let them, screen controling if the host allows that, locking the meeting so no one else could join, chat so they could send someone privately in the group chat. More you think meeting to let people not be doodling on the chat, no sharing screen if the host commanded that. Also, more privacy related settings like admiting the person to join, only the host could report people maybe some dangerous bots or what... More layers as it gots 2. Meet gots 3.
