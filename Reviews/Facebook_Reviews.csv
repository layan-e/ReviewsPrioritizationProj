But Facebook does not benefit me as a member because I need to wait for a day or two to join a community and leaders or admins to approve my posts. I have sent a join request for one of the community which is pending for a week and a pending post for 2-3 days for leaders or admins to approve. They are not strict enough. Members in Facebook communities like to spam pictures or asking for photos. Their posts will surely be disabled by the leaders and curators in their communities in Amino Apps (especially in Anime Communities) as their posts are either off-topic, might be an artist's art which does not have proper credit to the original artist or no prove shoots which states that it's their art, or not enough sentences in their posts. This will add work to leaders and curators in Amino Apps if this happens as they will need to disable a lot of posts which is posted in Facebook communities .
