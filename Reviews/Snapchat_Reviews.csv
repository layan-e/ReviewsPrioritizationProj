There's ones that are like right there when you open snap. And there's a button at the bottom with another huge selection. They're just overall amazing. There is one thing that I would want fixed though. When you're on ft or call with someone you cant swipe off of their name when ur trying to check another snap you got. But you can get off of the app or turn ur phone off and it won't hang up. Fix??",,,,,,,

Although, the Snapchat app uses an insane amount of battery power, and at times it can be a little buggy. Fixes for those would be great! A few things I want to see from Snapchat would be a) dark mode (please) and b) when you click links for filters, an option to keep them for a custom amount of time or until a certain date. Thanks for being awesome, snap!",,,,,,,

I don't like that it needs my location to do filters. I'm worried about Safety . Snapchat needs to do better with Safety !! But overall it's a good app for pictures and chatting.",,,,,,,

The 2nd time I was just permanently locked out but with the 2nd time I was asleep for 3 hrs and wasn't on it. I woke up and I was locked. Snapchat needs to fix that because it's rather annoying to find accounts locked when I wasn't doing anything against the terms of service. No third party apps were being used and there was no spam.,,,,,,,

,3554,leo portillo,30-Jul-20,1,3, The new update when you go to view friends stories is terrible. The discover section is terrible because it makes me go through all the squares instead of choosing which one I was to look at. Thats when I actually do go through them.,,,,,,,
