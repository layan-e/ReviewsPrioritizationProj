Youtube,838,Anthony Tueffel,13-Sep-20,1,284, Your ads have become overly obnoxious. I watch a 3 minute video and then a 5 minute ad. Your service more ad than video at this point. Every 3 or so minutes I have to stop what I'm doing otherwise I'm listen to the same ads over and over again. Your service is absolutely the worst.,,,,,,
